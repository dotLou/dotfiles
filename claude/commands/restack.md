I need you to restack this graphite stack via `gt restack`.

You have no need to check the current status of git.

When you hit a conflict, you will figure out the purpose of the PR you are restacking and confirm with me before blindly making changes.

Absolutely do not use `git commit` commands or `git push` commands. You can use `git add` and `git status` commands, but otherwise you will default to `gt` commands.
